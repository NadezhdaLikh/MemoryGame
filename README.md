# Memory Game – a simple matching puzzle game
## Overview

This project is a memory game (also known as a matching game), a classic puzzle designed to train memory and attention.
The goal is to find all the matching pairs of cards on the game board.

At the start of the game, all cards are shown face-up, and the player must try to remember their positions. Then the cards are flipped face-down, and the challenge begins: flip two at a time and try to find pairs.

The game includes:
+ Choice of the number of cards (from 1 to 10).
+ Two difficulty levels:
  + **easy** – cards are labeled with _numbers_.
  + **hard** – cards display _names of geometric shapes_.
+ **Penalty points** for every mismatched pair.
+ A main menu with an "Instructions" button (instructions are in English).

## Technologies used
+ **Java** – core programming language.
+ **Java Swing** – for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), using components such as: JButton, JPanel, JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, JTextArea.
+ **Java AWT** (Abstract Window Toolkit) – the original GUI widget toolkit in Java, providing cross-platform windowing and graphics support.

## Features
+ Interactive GUI window with customizable game settings.
+ Supports both number-based and shape-based cards.
+ Penalty point system encourages careful memorization.
+ Simple and intuitive instructions accessible from the main menu.
